## Description

At its core, YUView is a YUV player and analysis tool. However, it can do so much more:
* simple navigation/zooming in the video
* support for a wide variety of YUV formats using various subsamplings and bit depts
* support for raw RGB files, image files and image sequences
* direct decoding of raw h.265/HEVC bitstreams with visualization of internals like prediction modes and motion vectors and many more
* interface with visualization for the reference software decoders HM and JEM
* support for opening almost any file using FFmpeg
* image comparison using side-by-side and comparison view
* calculation and display of differences (in YUV or RGB colorspace)
* save and load playlists
* overlay the video with statistics data
* ... and many more

Further details of the features can be found either [here](http://ient.github.io/YUView) or

If none of these apply to you, you can easily [build YUView yourself](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki/Compile-YUView).

## Building

Compiling YUView from source is easy! We use qmake for the project so on all supported platforms you just have to install qt and run `qmake` and `make` to build YUView. Alternatively, you can use the QTCreator if you prefer a GUI. More help on building YUView can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki/Compile-YUView).
